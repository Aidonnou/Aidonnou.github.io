I"N<p>Welcome!!!</p>

<p>This is Albert, I am from Tortosa, Catalonia. Currently, I live in The Netherlands.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I needed to connect with my childhood and homeland, so I started pottery and ceramics. I have been practicing ceramics in different studios in Denmark and The Netherlands; I also assisted in one of the weeks of the workshop at the Almond Grove of the renowned <a href="https://www.hectormavridis.com/">Hector’s Mavridis</a> during the summer of 2021.</p>

<p>I am based at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kadewerk/">Kadewerk</a>, working with diverse clays and techniques, aiming to combine my homeland’s and Japanese pottery styles.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in any workpiece or in having personalized classes.</p>

Welcome!!!

This is Albert, I am from Tortosa, Catalonia. Currently, I live in The Netherlands.

A few years ago, I needed to connect with my childhood and homeland, so I started pottery and ceramics. I have been practicing ceramics in different studios in Denmark and The Netherlands; I also assisted in one of the weeks of the workshop at the Almond Grove of the renowned [Hector's Mavridis](https://www.hectormavridis.com/) during the summer of 2021.

I am based at [Kadewerk](https://www.facebook.com/kadewerk/), working with diverse clays and techniques, aiming to combine my homelandâ€™s and Japanese pottery styles. 

Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in any workpiece or in having personalized classes.

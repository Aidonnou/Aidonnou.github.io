Welcome! 

This is Albert, I am from Tortosa, Catalonia. Currently I live in The Netherlands. 

Few years ago I had need to connect with his childhood and homeland, so I started pottery and ceramics as a hobby.

I have been practising ceramics in different studios in Denmark and in The Netherlands, I also assisted to one of the week the workshop at the Almond Grove of the renowned [Hector's Mavridis](https://www.hectormavridis.com/) during the summer of 2021. 

Nowadays, Albert I am based at [Kadewerk](https://www.facebook.com/kadewerk/), where I work with a diversity of different types of clay and techniques, practising and experimenting every day. 

Do not hesitate on contacting me if you are interested in any workpiece or in having personalized classes.

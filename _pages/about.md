Born in 1991 in Tortosa, Catalonia. Lived in several countries, Spain, Italy, Denmark, New Zealand and currently in The Netherlands.

With the need of connecting with his childhood started pottery and ceramics as a hobby.
This evolved into a passion, teleporting himself to his home country, where pottery has been a tradition for centuries.

After being practicing ceramics in different studies in Denmark and in The Netherlands assisted to [Hector's Mavridis](https://www.hectormavridis.com/) workshop at the Almond Grove during summer 2021. 

Currently, besides his everyday job at University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), he is a potter based at [Kadewerk](https://www.facebook.com/kadewerk/) where he is working with a diversity of different types of clay and techniques, practicing and experimenting everyday. 

Albert presents his work as "humble, unpretentious and minimalist", presenting the raw beauty of the uncovered baked clay keeping the balance between glaze and clay, giving both of them the same importance.

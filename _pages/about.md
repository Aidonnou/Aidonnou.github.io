Born in 1991 in Tortosa, Catalonia. Currently based in The Netherlands.

With the need to connect with his childhood and homeland, he started pottery and ceramics as a hobby, which became a passion.

After practising ceramics in different studios in Denmark and The Netherlands, he assisted in the workshop at the Almond Grove of the renowned [Hector's Mavridis](https://www.hectormavridis.com/) during the summer of 2021. 

Nowadays, Albert is a potter based at [Kadewerk](https://www.facebook.com/kadewerk/), where he works with a diversity of different types of clay and techniques, practising and experimenting every day. 

Albert presents his work as "humble, unpretentious and minimalist". He is showing the raw beauty of the uncovered baked clay keeping the balance between glaze and clay, giving both of them the same importance.
